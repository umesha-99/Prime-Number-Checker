# Prime-Number-Checker
The "Prime Number Checker" allows users to determine whether a given integer is a prime number or not.

This repository contains both a Java Swing application and a simple web application for checking whether a given number is prime or not. Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. These applications provide different ways to perform this check.

Java Swing Application: 
The Java Swing application is a desktop-based program.
It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for checking prime numbers.
Users can input a number and receive instant feedback on its primality.
Users can enter an number in the input field.
Upon clicking the "Check" button, the application checks if the input number is prime or not.
The result (prime or not prime) is displayed in the result label.

Web Application: 
The web application is accessible via a web browser.
Users can input a number on the web page.
Upon submission, the web application checks if the input number is prime and displays the result on the same page.
